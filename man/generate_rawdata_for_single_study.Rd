\title{Generate Snapshots of Study Data}
\usage{
generate_rawdata_for_single_study(
  SnapshotCount,
  ParticipantCount,
  SiteCount,
  StudyID,
  combined_specs,
  desired_specs = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{SnapshotCount}{An integer specifying the number of snapshots to generate.}

\item{ParticipantCount}{An integer specifying the number of participants in the study.}

\item{SiteCount}{An integer specifying the number of sites for the study.}

\item{StudyID}{A string specifying the study identifier.}

\item{combined_specs}{A list of specifications for the raw data variables, where each element contains
variable-generating functions for different data types (e.g., "Raw_AE", "Raw_ENROLL").}

\item{desired_specs}{A list of specifications of the data types that should be included. Default values include:
'Raw_STUDY', 'Raw_SITE', 'Raw_SUBJ', 'Raw_ENROLL', 'Raw_AE', 'Raw_PD'.}
}
\value{
A list of data snapshots, where each element contains simulated data for a particular snapshot
period (typically a month), with variables populated according to the provided specifications.
}
\description{
This function generates a list of study data snapshots based on the provided specifications,
including participant count, site count, study ID, and the number of snapshots to be generated.
The data is simulated over a series of months, with key variables such as subject enrollment,
adverse events, and time on study being populated according to the study's specifications.
}
\details{
The function generates snapshots over a sequence of months, starting from \code{"2012-01-01"}. For each snapshot:
\enumerate{
\item The number of adverse events (\code{ae_num}) is simulated.
\item The number of participants screened is determined.
\item Key variables (such as subject ID, enrollment date, time on study, etc.) are populated for each data type
specified in \code{combined_specs}.
}
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Define variable-generating functions
some_function <- function(...) { ... }

# Generate 5 snapshots of study data
snapshots <- generate_snapshot(
  SnapshotCount = 5,
  ParticipantCount = 100,
  SiteCount = 10,
  StudyID = "Study01",
  combined_specs = list(
    "Raw_AE" = list("subjid" = some_function, ...),
    "Raw_ENROLL" = list("subjid" = some_function, ...)
  )
)
}
